\chapter{Work Undertaken}
The majority of my time in the team has been spent on report development for BIR, GBST's Business Intelligence Reporting solution (see section 2.1.1). BIR is based upon JasperSoft's \textit{JasperReports Server}\footnote{Jaspersoft JasperReports Server - http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-server}. The report templates we write consist of SQL queries, Java report generation code and an XML UI layout. The application itself is a Java webserver.

\section{Software development cycle exposure}

In the CM Java team, I had the opportunity to participate in \textit{all} stages of the software development lifecycle across the products I worked on:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Project Planning, Feasibility} - I was an active participant in discussing and raising ideas for future features of our products in team meetings, especially for automating development processes (see section 3.2)
\item \textbf{Systems analysis, requirements definition} - I was often called upon to provide effort estimates, feasibility analysis and other recommendations for new product features or report templates
\item \textbf{Systems design} - I often consulted with product owners, business analysts and other team members to ensure the business logic and UI layout of BIR reports, installation tools and other product features I was about to create fitted their expectations
\item \textbf{Implementation} - I wrote new queries and report templates for BIR on request (either internally or by clients) and added features to the application
\item \textbf{Integration and testing} - I participated in regression testing at each release of BIR, where the released application and all reports would be loaded on a dedicated testing server
\item \textbf{Acceptance, installation, deployment} - I was involved in improving documentation for and automating our installation and deployment processes (again, see section 3.2)
\item \textbf{Maintenance} - I fixed bugs in reports and the BIR application, added features upon request, upgraded servers and deployed new versions of BIR and its reports
\end{itemize}

\section{Responsibilities in team}

There are many roles and responsibilities in a software development team aside from planning, developing and maintaining the products.

I have been involved in roles as broad as:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Documentation} - creating manuals and checklists; documenting the team's development processes, product features and tools on an internal Atlassian Confluence wiki
\item \textbf{On-call} - being available to provide over-the-phone (internal) assistance for the products I have knowledge on outside business hours
\item \textbf{POC} - the team would periodically complete proof-of-concept work to demonstrate that an upcoming feature of one of our products was feasible or to provide a demonstration for managers/clients. These were very diverse and enjoyable to work on, and ranged from testing our products on different web application servers and database servers, to creating web front-end mockups for a mobile application and a new product (see \textit{GBST Margin\texttrademark}\footnote{GBST Margin - http://gbst.com/our-expertise/capital-markets-expertise/marginsuite})
\item \textbf{Process Automation} - a large part of the independent work I did at GBST involved process automation for BIR developers. This included tasks such as automating the conversion of SQL scripts between different dialects via a Python script, maintaining a set of automated jobs on a build server for compiling code and deploying it to test servers, maintaining/upgrading a Linux development server distributed to each BIR developer (with common tasks automated by Bash scripts), and assisting other team members to create an automated upgrade tool for BIR installations.
\item \textbf{Scrum} - I was an active participant in the scrum process, suggesting improvements and raising issues at retrospective meetings
\item \textbf{Training} - preparing material for and delivering training on the team's products, processes and tools. This included training new employees and existing ones, both in person in the Brisbane office and via teleconference in our international offices
