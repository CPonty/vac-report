\footnotetext[1]{As per Bachelor of Engineering Rule 6.1, each of the 60 'days' of professional practice must include at least 7.5 hours of work. Unfortunately, many of my working days have totalled less than 7.5 hours. 
\\ \\ 
As I've been employed at GBST for over 3 years, going through my timesheets and counting days which meet the requirement would be quite tedious. I trust the fact that I have logged over 1,000 hours' work there will be sufficient. }
