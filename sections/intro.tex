\chapter{Introduction}

In order to gain exposure to professional engineering practices, University of Queensland Engineering students are required to complete 60 days of work experience within an engineering environment prior to graduation. This report covers my professional practice exposure while employed at GBST (Global Banking \& Securities Transactions), beginning 31$^{st}$ January 2011.
\\

GBST is a mid-sized, international finance software company, providing "specialist market access and transaction processing solutions for the global financial services industry." \cite{asx} I was employed in their Brisbane office as an intern deeveloper in the Capital Markets (formerly Broker Services) division, in a Java-based software development team.
\\

An overview of the company is followed by a description of the work I have been involved in. The report concludes with an assessment of the value of the work experience I have undertaken.
